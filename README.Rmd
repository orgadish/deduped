# deduped

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `deduped` is to provide a utility function that makes it easier to speed up functions that are commonly run on vectors with significant duplication.

## Installation

You can install the development version of deduped like so:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("orgadish/dedup")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(deduped)
x <- sample(LETTERS, 10)
x

large_x <- sample(rep(x, 100))
length(large_x)

slow_func <- function(x) for(i in x) {Sys.sleep(0.001)}

system.time({y <- slow_func(large_x)})
system.time({y2 <- dedup(slow_func)(large_x)})
all(y == y2)
```
