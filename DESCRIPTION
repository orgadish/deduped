Version: 0.1.3
Authors@R:
    person("Or", "Gadish", email = "orgadish@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Description: Contains one main function deduped() that returns a 
    function that acts on the unique values of the first input
    and expands the results back. This can significantly speed
    up certain slow iterative functions.
